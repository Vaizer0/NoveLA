## Translation

Four backends supported. Multiple API keys are rotated round-robin on rate limits.

| Backend | Cost | API key |
|---|---|---|
| Google Translate (Enhanced) | Free | Not required |
| Google Translate (Simple) | Free | Not required |
| Google Gemini | Free tier | Required |
| OpenAI-compatible | Varies | Required |

OpenAI-compatible accepts OpenAI, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, Ollama, Mistral, and any compatible endpoint.

Parallel mode displays original and translated text side by side. Novel-specific prompts let you customize translation behavior per book.

## CI & Live Testing

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds debug APKs and uploads them as artifacts on push/PR to `main`.

- **Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/android-build.yml`
- **What it does:** runs `./gradlew assembleDebug` and uploads `**/app/build/outputs/**/*.apk` as the artifact `NoveLA-debug-apks`.
- **Download the APK:** Go to the repository on GitHub → Actions → select a run → Artifacts → download the APK and install on device or emulator.

Optional: browser testing via Appetize.io. To enable automatic upload, add the repository secret `APPETIZE_UPLOAD_TOKEN` with your Appetize API token. The workflow will upload any `*-debug.apk` it builds.

How to push and enable CI (example):

```bash
# create GitHub repo (if you haven't) and push
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/<repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

After pushing, open the repository on GitHub and the Actions tab; the workflow will run on the pushed commits.

If you want a cloud editing/dev environment, consider enabling GitHub Codespaces or adding a `.devcontainer` configuration — I can scaffold that if you want.
